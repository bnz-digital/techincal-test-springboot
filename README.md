# BNZ Technical Test - Spring Boot

Hello ðŸ‘‹

Thank you so much for taking the time to interview with us here at BNZ. Before the in-person/remote interview, we'd appreciate if you could begin a small exercise, which will facilitate some discussion during the interview.

This isn't a exam, there are no right or wrong solutions. We are more interested in your approach and reasoning behind the decisions you have (or would) implement.

1. Use [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) to scaffold a Spring Rest project.
2. Add an endpoint that retrieves weather data from here https://open-meteo.com/en/docs for Wellington
3. Return the response

##  Notes

1. Use whichever libraries you feel conformable with.
2. Add your source code to GitHub and send us the link.

Thanks!
